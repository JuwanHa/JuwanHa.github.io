*Dougong* is a basic component of traditional Chinese wood structure. Nowadays, *Dougong* has become the cultural expression of Chinese architectural. In **Ruyi**, through the ingenious combination of big pillars and bucket holes, the reasonable distribution of force makes the whole building stable atmosphere. The design of the top grid can not only shade in summer, but also produce beautiful light and shadow effect. 

**Tracing back to the source** is the historical building group model of Central South University (CSU), which refers to tracing back to the source of the development of CSU. From the beginning of the design, we decided to show the architectural details as much as possible, close to the actual landscape, and reflect the profound history and culture of CSU. From "four layers" of architectural color to "four sets" of lighting system, from a brush of paint to a piece of vegetation, all reflect the planner's "craftsman spirit".
