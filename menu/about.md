title: Hi, this is Haoyu.

Hi, Iâ€™m Haoyu, majored in Urban Planning in *University of Washington*.

When I was a child, I love watching the changes that happened in my city, so I gradually began to like to draw some city maps and to explore the behind mechanisms that shape the city as well as how the cities affect our everyday life, then I chose planning as my major.

Most of the knowledge I learned during my undergraduate is so concentrated on how to draw beautiful blueprints. However, I have little ideas about how our cities grow and work, which I think is the foundation of planning. So now, I would like to explore some small points that are not very concentrated by the planners.

I think the knowledge of the city is like a net. Every additional point can be connected with other points to form a new relationship. I prefer to have a comprehensive network, rather than a large node. I hope that in the future, Chinese citizens are not only shocked by some aerial videos but also feel good just because they live in a real and wonderful city.
