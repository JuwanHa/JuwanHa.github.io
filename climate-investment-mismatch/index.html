    <i>I wish to develop a dashboard for myself, even the decision-makers, 
      to discover the money flow behind climate investment. In terms of visualization techniques, 
      I may try my best to use D3.js to create the dashboard. Also, I wish to make it based on my personal website.
      I will also clone one copy to our cse repository in later submission.</i>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
    California Climate Initiative Fund (CCIF), generated from the largest carbon market in the United 
    States - California Cap-and-Trade, are supporting a series of programs and projects statewide to reduce 
    greenhouse gas emissions and deliver other economic, environmental, and public health benefits for all. </p>

    <b>Here we will have a dashboard for user to explore some statistics and projects.</b>

  <div class="docs-section" id="pollution">
    <h3>Pollution and Investment</h3>
    <p>
      Different from equity planning with the core goal to achieve social equity, the process of carbon 
      trade-investment, however, focuses on equity from a reparative view. One of the most important legal 
      foundations of carbon trade is that the credits paid by polluting installations for carbon credits are 
      used to correct the negative externalities caused by pollution. The negative externality has the 
      greatest impact on the surrounding communities of polluting installations spatially and should 
      receive more "compensation". 
    </p>
    <b>There will be a parallel coordinates plot with climate risk index, pollution index, 
      and climate investment intensity in each community. This plot can select same community with following one plot.</b>

      Construct the spatial mismatch index based on different combination of socioeconomic variables.
