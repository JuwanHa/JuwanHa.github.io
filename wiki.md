### Weather vs Climate

- What Factors Influence Climate?
	-   **Sunshine**
	-   Topography/mountains
	-   Proximity to oceans and large lakes
	-   Ocean currents
	-   Presence of trees/vegetation
	-   Heat-trapping gases
- 90% of the mass of the atmosphere is within 16 km (10 miles) of the surface
- A thin atmosphere means industrial activity can change atmospheric composition


### Carbon Dioxide

- Greenhouse gases slow heat loss to space, and make the earth 58 F (32 C) warmer
- Earth is warmed about _1.2 C (2.2 F)_ in the last 170 years
    -  Warming has happened almost everywhere. Northern high latitudes have warmed the most. Land has warmed more than ocean.
