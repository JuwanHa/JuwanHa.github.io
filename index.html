      Hi, I'm Haoyu Yue, a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/urbdpphd/">Urban Design & Planning Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program</a> at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA. 
      I'm also a part of the <a href="https://uil.be.uw.edu/">Urban Infrastructure Lab</a> led by 
      <a href="https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/jan-whittington/">Prof. Jan Whittington</a> at UW 
      and the oversea city observer of <a href="http://www.urbanchina.com.cn/">Urban China Magazine</a>. 
      I have always had a passion about all stuff related to the city. 
      Now my research interests include infrastructure planning, urban carbon governance, and the combination of urban studies and data science.

    <p>
    Urban Informatics is an unofficial <a href='https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/programs/mup-graduate-degree/specializations/'>specialization</a> at UW. 
    Anyone who is willing to choose this area needs to submit the Individualized Specialization Application to get permission. 
    I chose this path and <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/informatics'>here</a> is the my master's curriculum for reference.
    Before graduate school, I did <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/undergraduate'>some practical and design-based works</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addtion to urban planning core course series, I plan to complete three course clusters for getting a solid knowledge backgroud. 
    First, <a href='https://evans.uw.edu/academic-programs/ph-d-concentration-in-public-policy-management/'>Public Policy and Institutions</a>, focuses on theoretical and practical knowledge related to planning tradeoffs, such as game theory, microeconomics, and institutions. 
    Second, Climate and Infrastructure, can help me understand the relationship between climate and cities. 
    Third, Statistics and Data Science, as the pillar of studying urban science, will allow me to pursue <a href='https://stat.uw.edu/academics/graduate/programs/masters'>MS in Statistics</a> and <a herf='https://escience.washington.edu/education/phd/advanced-phd-data-science-option/'>eScience Data Science Option</a>.
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/phd-curriculum">Here</a> is my course plan for Ph.D. stage.
