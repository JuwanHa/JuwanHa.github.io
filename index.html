      I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/urbdpphd/">Urban Design & Planning Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program</a> at the University of Washington, Seattle WA. 
      I'm also a part of the <a href="https://uil.be.uw.edu/">Urban Infrastructure Lab</a> led by 
      <a href="https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/jan-whittington/">Prof. Jan Whittington</a> at UW 
      and the oversea city observer of <a href="http://www.urbanchina.com.cn/">Urban China Magazine</a>. 
      I have always had a passion about all stuff related to the city. 
      Now my research interests include infrastructure planning, urban carbon governance, and the combination of urban studies and data science.

    <h2>Coursework</h2>
    <p>
      During my Ph.D. stage, I plan to complete several course clusters, including public policy and institutions, climate and infrastructure, 
      data science and statistics, for getting a solid knowledge background at the beginning of two years. 
      The arrangement is a continuation of my previous master's program at UW which focused on Urban Informatics. 
      And please [check](https://yohaoyu.github.io/pages/phd-curriculum) my coursework list to see what I've done and my future plans.
