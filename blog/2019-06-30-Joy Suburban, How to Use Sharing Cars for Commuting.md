During the process of integration of Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan Urban Agglomeration, the "green heart" among the three cities has been retained, and the "green heart" area has a certain distance from the three cities, that is, it belongs to the suburbs of the three cities, the public transport system is not perfect, and the residents' travel problems are significant, which reduces the happiness of the residents in the region. With the rapid development of car sharing in recent years, more car sharing sites have been set up in the three cities of Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangtan, which can be used to improve the travel mode of residents in this area and improve the travel efficiency. But at present, due to the weak mode and imperfect system, there are many problems, which affect the improvement of travel quality service for the residents in the region. Therefore, this paper analyzes the problem on the basis of it, combined with the background of the integration of Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan Urban Agglomeration, and optimizes it from multiple angles.
