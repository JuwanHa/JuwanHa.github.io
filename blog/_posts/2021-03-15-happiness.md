Why is the scientific study of happiness important? In short, most people believe that happiness is meaningful, desirable, and an important, worthy goal. Happiness is one of the most salient and significant dimensions of human experience and emotional life, because happiness yields numerous rewards for the individual, and because it makes for a better, healthier, stronger society. (Sonja Lyubomirsky, 2014)

According to psychology, happiness is about more than simply the experience of a positive mood. In order to describe happiness, psychologists commonly refer to subjective well-being. In other words, happiness is “people’s evaluations of their lives and encompasses both cognitive judgments of satisfaction and affective appraisals of moods and emotions” (Kesebir & Diener, 2008, p. 118).

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the lives of billions of people around the world. There's a lot of uncertainty in this unprecedented time, and people's expectations about the future are very volatile. Negative emotions such as fear, stress, anxiety, and depression are inevitable and can overwhelm even the most optimistic person.
