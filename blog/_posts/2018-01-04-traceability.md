**Tracing back to the source** is the historical building group model of Central South University (CSU), which refers to tracing back to the source of the development of CSU. From the beginning of the design, we decided to show the architectural details as much as possible, close to the actual landscape, and reflect CSU's profound history and culture. From "four layers" of architectural color to "four sets" of the lighting system, from a brush of paint to a piece of vegetation, all reflect the planner's "craftsman spirit".
