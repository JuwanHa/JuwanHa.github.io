**Tracing back to the source** is the historical building group model of Central South University (CSU), which refers to tracing back to the source of the development of CSU. From the beginning of the design, we decided to show the architectural details as much as possible, close to the actual landscape, and reflect the profound history and culture of CSU. From "four layers" of architectural color to "four sets" of lighting system, from a brush of paint to a piece of vegetation, all reflect the planner's "craftsman spirit".
