title: "My Personal Literature Reading Workflow"
author: "Haoyu"

When I am enrolled into a new class with heavy reading workload, or just exploring interesting topics on the Internet, I tended to just read it and put it into a huge fold with all different papers I already 'read'. However, it's hard for me to relocate a paper or review them in the sequence of a course. What should I do to prevent me from "reading without any get and organization"? Now, Sep, 2021, I have tried a lot and get a relatively pretty workflow to organize all.

## Software and Packages                             

Anybody has his/her own preferences about the choices of assistants. So I just recommend the software I use and get some alternative suggestions, even I seldomly use them.
