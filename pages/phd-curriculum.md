## Master Stage (Urban Informatics)

Urban Informatics is not an official [specialization](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/programs/mup-graduate-degree/specializations/) at UW. So anyone who is willing to choose this area needs to submit the *Individualized Specialization Application* for getting permission. I chose this path which broaden my skillsets and here is my curriculum for reference.
